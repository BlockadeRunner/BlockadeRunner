# Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹


I am a student at the **College of William & Mary**, seeking a Bachelor's in **Computer Science with a Data Science minor** as of 2024. My passions include Cybersecurity Analysis and Penetration Testing, Software Development, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing for IoT Devices.

Here are some interesting classes I have taken throughout college:

- Applied Cybersecurity
- Mobile Application Security
- Intro to Edge Computing
- Intro to HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)
- Web Programming

I am currently training and testing a deep learning autopilot on a small scale autonomous vehicle in the Vehicle Computing Lab at William and Mary. Check out some video demonstrations here: https://sidilu.org/lab.html

## Projects  
#### BetweenUs (Mobile App)   
I am the lead developer, tester, and debugger on a team of four that built a mobile application which aims to facilitate seamless meetups between friends by determining the optimal midpoint between their respective locations. Check it out here:

#### Sculptor (2024 &hacks hackathon winner)   
I worked on a team of 4 to develop a proof of concept for using muscle sensors and servos to electronically power and control 3d printed prosthetic solutions. Check out our hackathon-winning design here:
